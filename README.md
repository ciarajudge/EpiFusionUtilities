# EpiFusionUtilities

This is EpiFusionUtilities, an R package with useful tools for using the [EpiFusion joint phylodynamic and epidemiological inference software](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion). This repository contains the package source code, and information on usage. The science behind the EpiFusion software can be found in this preprint: https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.18.572106v1.


## Getting Started

To get started with EpiFusionUtilities you can install it using devtools and the `install_github` command. In R, that looks like this: 

  ```
  devtools::install_github("https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusionUtilities")
  ```

We recommend using following the tutorials on the [EpiFusion wiki](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/wiki) where there is lots of useful instructions on how to use `EpiFusionUtilities` to interact with the EpiFusion software.
